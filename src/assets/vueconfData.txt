        Event: RENDERING REVEALED (Adam Jahr)
        Description: Ever feel like you're drowning in the alphabet soup of options for rendering your web apps? SPA, CSR, RSC, SSR, SSG, ISR... ðŸ¤¯

We can leverage this to build accessible reusable widgets with the help of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application). Using ARIA roles and attributes, we can improve the accessibility of certain elements by providing additional semantics. In this talk, we will go over how to follow the specifications and build accessible and reusable tabs, accordions, toggle buttons, and modal dialogs that work for everyone!

        Event: HOW TO BUILD FAST NUXT 3 APPLICATIONS - PRPL PATTERN IN PRACTICE (Filip Rakowski)
        Description:Despite growing awareness about the importance of performance and the availability of tools like Lighthouse that allow to measure it with few clicks, we see most of the Single Page Applications being just slow. Most of the SPAs out there donâ€™t pass core web vitals.

        Why? The short answer is JavaScript. Following the standard way of building web applications means that adding every new component or feature equals adding more JavaScript. More JavaScript equals slower page loads.

        Does it mean we are doomed and every feature-rich application just had to be slow? Not at all! During this talk I want to share with you the PRPL patterns that will help you to achieve fast page loads even in large and complex applications. We will explore different stages of application growth, learn about the most common bottlenecks, and how to minimize their impact on the overall page performance. All of that using the latest and greatest iteration of Nuxt.js!

A Vue 3 codebase will be provided that leverages Google's TensorFlow.js and several pre-trained model implementations. We'll talk a little about what TensorFlow.js is, and how you can easily pull in these powerful ML models in your own projects! By the end of the talk, you'll be comfortable using the codebase as a jumping off point to start using TF.js in your own Vue projects!

But while focused on rapid feature development, you may find your app's performance leaves much to be desired.In this talk, we'll explore performance-minded development patterns that leverage built-in Nuxt 3 utilities, community-created modules, and an enhanced understanding of Nuxt's SSR lifecycle and hydration processes. From measurement and benchmarks to techniques and practical examples, you'll leave with a robust toolkit in hand to supercharge the speed of your next Nuxt app.

        Event: VUE.JS HYDRATION DEMYSTIFIED (Alexander Lichter)
        Description: Server-side rendering in Vue has lots of benefits. Especially with frameworks like Nuxt.js, developing SSR Vue applications is a breeze, no matter if you use dynamic SSR or static site generation. But on the other hand, server-side rendering also comes with a fair increase of complexity and errors you might have not seen before. While most of them are documented and workarounds are available, one error still boggles lots of minds: When Vue hydration fails.
        In this talk, we will have a deeper look into Vue's hydration process and explore together why it is needed in the first place, what it actually does and how it can "fail".
        Next, various scenarios of failing hydration are showcased, together with how to debug these scenarios properly.
        After this talk, you will have a deep understanding of the hydration process and possible errors will be easy to debug for you.

        Event: FETCHING DATA AND THE PERCEPTION OF SPEED (Rijk van Zanten)
        Description:Users expect applications to respond instantly, but these expectations are not just about the raw speed of data retrieval, but managing user perception.
        In this talk, we'll explore how to increase perceived performance and discuss strategic slowdowns, which can sometimes lead to a more engaging user experience, using real-world examples from large open source Vue projects.
      - Time: 4:30 PM
        Event: VUE, YOU AND AI SEARCH (Daniel Madalitso Phiri)
        Chat is the new Search! Or is it? Large language models have brought about a new era in application development. Search being the biggest winner!
        In this talk, Iâ€™ll go through the evolution of building search applications and get into the technology that enables chat-like search in modern applications. Weâ€™ll also look at how we can future-proof our applications and build them to scale without sacrificing the user experience.
        Besides the history lesson, at the end of this talk, you too will have an idea of how to go about building AI-enabled search experiences!
